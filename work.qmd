I'm passionate about exploring the intersections of history, technology, and culture. Whether delving into archival research or planning my next leisure project, my work is always driven by curiosity and a desire to bridge past and present.

## Current Projects

### Master Thesis
**"Between Homes and Records: Uxorilocal and Non-Virilocal Practices, Record-Keeping, and Reconciliation in Late Imperial China"**

I'm currently immersed in my master thesis, where I explore the complexities of family life in 16th to 18th century South China. My research investigates how traditional family norms were both recorded and reconciled with everyday realities, focusing on uxorilocal and non-virilocal practices and the role of record-keeping in shaping familial relationships.

Alongside my academic work, I'm finalizing plans for some dedicated gaming time on my PS5 during the upcoming summer breakâ€”a well-deserved pause that fuels my creativity and provides a fun counterbalance to my research.

    "text": "Hi there!\nI’m Wenxin Xiao, currently a master’s student studying the social history of late Imperial China. I was born and raised in Guangzhou, China, and came to the U.S. for school when I was 18.\nBesides history, I have a lot of hobbies—but the two most important to me are video games (I own a PS4, a Switch, and I’m about to get a PS5!) and anime. I’m probably not your typical “classic” Chinese history student, since I also have a strong background in programming and I am committed to digital humanities. Thanks to my undergraduate experience at UW–Madison, I earned a dual degree in History and Data Science.\nIn addition to spending time online gaming and surfing the web, I’m also trying to get more into physical exercise and spending time in nature. I’ve tried a few times before (and failed), but hopefully this time I’ll succeed!"

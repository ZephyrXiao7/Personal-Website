    "section": "",
    "text": "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry’s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."

    "section": "",
    "text": "It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ‘Content here, content here’, making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ‘lorem ipsum’ will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)."

    "text": "Hi there!\nI’m Wenxin Xiao, currently a master’s student studying the social history of late Imperial China. I was born and raised in Guangzhou, China, and came to the U.S. for school when I was 18.\nBesides history, I have a lot of hobbies—but the two most important to me are video games (I own a PS4, a Switch, and I’m about to get a PS5!) and anime. I’m probably not your typical “classic” Chinese history student, since I also have a strong background in programming and I am committed to digital humanities. Thanks to my undergraduate experience at UW–Madison, I earned a dual degree in History and Data Science.\nIn addition to spending time online gaming and surfing the web, I’m also trying to get more into physical exercise and spending time in nature. I’ve tried a few times before (and failed), but hopefully this time I’ll succeed!"

My research investigates how traditional family norms were both recorded and reconciled with everyday realities, focusing on uxorilocal and non-virilocal practices and the role of record-keeping in shaping familial relationships.\n\n\nGaming on PS5\nAlongside my academic work, I’m finalizing plans for some dedicated gaming time on my PS5 during the upcoming summer break—a well-deserved pause that fuels my creativity and provides a fun counterbalance to my research."
